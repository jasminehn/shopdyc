# Delivered at Your Convenience (DYC)

Delivered at your Convenience (DYC) is a 24 hour delivery service. Whether you need a bag of chips due to a craving in the middle of the night or you forgot your hairbrush in a new city, DYC has you covered! Just like Doordash but for your everyday needs! DYC is available in all major cities and most suburban areas. DYC also donates a portion of our delivery fees to COVID-19 relief.


The goals of DYC are as follows:
- Certain percentage of what we do goes to Covid relief
- Quick, affordable delivery ($2 flat fee)
- Fast and more affordable delivery


NOTE: This website is still currently in development. The goal is to build an identical version of [this Wix site](https://jnelson209.wixsite.com/shopdyc) from scratch in React.js. The concept was originally created for a class project for COM140.
